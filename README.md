Fast and versatile argument checks for R.

Ever used an R function that produced a not-very-helpful error message,
just to discover after minutes of debugging that you simply passed a wrong argument?

Blaming the laziness of the package author for not doing such standard checks
(in a dynamically typed language such as R) is at least partially unfair, as R makes theses types of checks
cumbersome and annoying. Well, that's how it was in the past.

Enter checkmate.

Virtually **every standard type of user error** when passing arguments into function can be
caught with a simple, readable line which produces an **informative error message** in case.
A substantial part of the package was written in C to **minimize any worries about execution time overhead**.
Furthermore, the package provides over 30 expectations to extend the popular [testthat package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests.
